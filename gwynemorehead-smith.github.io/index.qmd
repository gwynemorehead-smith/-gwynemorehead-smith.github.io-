### A highly motivated ESS undergraduate with 12 years of experience living in Colorado, bringing a deep understanding of local ecosystems and environmental challenges. I am passionate about sustainability and environmental stewardship and eager to apply my knowledge and strong work ethic to field research. I'm a quick learner, comfortable working in both field and office settings, and possess strong problem-solving and teamwork skills. I am particularly enthusiastic about gaining hands-on experience in the conservation of species.
